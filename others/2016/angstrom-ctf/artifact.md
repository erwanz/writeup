**Decrypted message:**
```
"through me you pass into the city of woe:
through me you pass into eternal pain: 
through me among the people lost for aye. 
justice the founder of my fabric moved: 
to rear me was the task of power divine, 
supremest wisdom, and primeval love. 
before me things create were none, save things 
eternal, and eternali shall endure. 
all hope abandon, ye who enter here.""
