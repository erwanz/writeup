### Solved by barrebas

A reversing challenge! We're given a 64-bit ELF executable. When we enter 'AAAA', the program says

```
bas@debian:~/csaw/rock$ ./rock
AAAA

Checking....
Too short or too long
```

I first fired up gdb and started the program. Halting the execution, I search for the string "Too short"

```
Temporary breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401260 in ?? ()
gdb-peda$ find "Too short"
Searching for 'Too short' in: None ranges
Found 1 results, display max 1 items:
rock : 0x401a1f ("Too short or too long")
```

Now in the disassembly, I looked for references to that string

```
  4016d7:       48 83 f8 1e             cmp    rax,0x1e
  4016db:       0f 95 c0                setne  al
  4016de:       84 c0                   test   al,al
  4016e0:       74 26                   je     401708 <_Unwind_Resume@plt+0x808>
  4016e2:       be 1f 1a 40 00          mov    esi,0x401a1f
```

Slightly above the reference, there's a comparision between what is presumed to be a length and the number 0x1e (30 in decimal). This appears to be the length of the string the program expects. 

```
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Checking....
You did not pass 0
```

Repeating the process for the string "You did not pass", I found

```
  40186b:       eb 36                   jmp    4018a3 <_Unwind_Resume@plt+0x9a3>
  40186d:       be 3b 1a 40 00          mov    esi,0x401a3b
```

The unconditional jmp means that the 'you did not pass' is reached from another piece of code:

```
  40182d:       e8 2e f6 ff ff          call   400e60 <_ZNSsixEm@plt>
  401832:       0f b6 00                movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
  401835:       38 c3                   cmp    bl,al
  401837:       0f 94 c0                sete   al
  40183a:       84 c0                   test   al,al
  40183c:       74 2f                   je     40186d <_Unwind_Resume@plt+0x96d>
```

OK, great. Firing up gdb again, placing a breakpoint at 0x401832 leaves me here:

```
RAX: 0x604138 ('>' <repeats 30 times>, "}")
RBX: 0x46 ('F')
...snip...
=> 0x401832:	movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
```

Hmm. The thirty As have been replaced with '>' and the first one is compared with 'F'. Smells like the beginning of 'FLAG' won't you say? I step over the 'je 0x40186d':

```
=> 0x40183c:	je     0x40186d
 | 0x40183e:	mov    esi,0x401a35
...snip...
gdb-peda$ set $rip=0x40183e
```

and end up here:

```
RAX: 0x604139 ('>' <repeats 29 times>, "}")
RBX: 0x4c ('L')
...
=> 0x401832:	movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
```

Repeating this process (actually, patching the JE to a JNE) yields the string the program wants:

```
FLAG23456912365453475897834567
```

But the input is mangled so this is not the flag. I noticed that each byte gets transformed to another byte, regardless of position or previous byte. All I had to do was to find the corresponding values (by running the program a few times, breaking at 0x401832 and observing the value pointed to by RAX). 

Finally, this gave the flag:

```python
>>> import maketrans from string
>>> intab = ">?@ABCDEFGH)*+,\r\016\017\020\021\022\023\024\025\026\027^_`abcdefghIJKL-./01234567mnopqrstuv89"
>>> outab = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789{\\"
>>> tab = maketrans(intab, outab)>>> "FLAG23456912365453475897834567".translate(tab)
'IoDJuvwxy\\tuvyxwxvwzx{\\z{vwxyz'
```

Entering 'IoDJuvwxy\tuvyxwxvwzx{\z{vwxyz':

```
bas@debian:~/csaw/rock$ ./rock
IoDJuvwxy\tuvyxwxvwzx{\z{vwxyz
