Upon connecting to the address that is supplied, we receive the following file:

```bash
nc crypto.chal.csaw.io 8000 |base64 -d > sleeping.png
```

And the file:

```
0000000: de3f 0f2f 524b 4541 6579 2132 1e27 053a  .?./RKEAey!2.'.:

```

This smells like a XOR encrypted image file. See the first few bytes, where it says 'ey!'? Could these be NULL bytes, encoded with something like 'key!' and divulging the XOR key? 

I guessed the received file would be a PNG, so I took the header of a normal PNG and XORed the first few bytes of the received file with the bytes of the normal PNG. This yielded 'WoAh_A_Key!?' and told me I was on the right track. A small python script later:


```python
#!/usr/bin/python


f = open("sleeping.png").read()

buf = ''
key = 'WoAh_A_Key!?'
for i in range(len(f)):
	buf = buf + chr(ord(f[i]) ^ ord(key[i % 12]))

print buf
```

And this gave the image

![sleeping guard](/images/2016/csaw/sleeping-guard/sleep.png)

With the flag 'flag{l4zy_H4CK3rs_d0nt_g3T_MAg1C_FlaG5}.
