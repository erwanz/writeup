We were provided by a web-page with a button named "click here". On 

```
 Flag Here
neoflag{NOT_THE_FLAG} 
```

By checking the view source we find 
```
console[String.fromCharCode(0x6c,0x6f,0x67)](String.fromCharCode(0x48,0x69,0x6e,0x74,
0x3a,0x20,0x52,0x61,0x72,0x65,0x20,0x43,0x68,0x61,0x6e,0x63,0x65,0x20,0x74,0x6f,0x20,0x72,
0x65,0x63,0x65,0x69,0x76,0x65,0x20,0x74,0x68,0x65,0x20,0x66,0x6c,0x61,0x67,0x2e,0x2e,0x2e,
0x20,0x4d,0x61,0x79,0x20,0x6e,0x65,0x65,0x64,0x20,0x73,0x6f,0x6d,0x65,0x20,0x63,0x6f,0x64,
0x69,0x6e,0x67,0x20,0x73,0x6b,0x69,0x6c,0x6c,0x73,0x20,0x3a,0x29));
```
we becomes "Hint: Rare Chance to receive the flag... May need some coding skills :)"

Intercepting the request by burp and sending it via curl

```
curl http://162.243.0.171/secret.php
neoflag{NOT_THE_FLAG} <img src='http://www.wordans.com/wordansfiles/images/2011/2/1/64884/64884_popup.jpg?1296583514'></img>
```

Putting this in while loop and do a invert grep for NOT and waiting for sometime, we get the flag
```
while [ 1 ]; do curl -s 'http://162.243.0.171/secret.php' | grep -v NOT; done
flag{T0O_M@ny_But10ns}
```
