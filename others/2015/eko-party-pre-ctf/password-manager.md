### Solved by NullMode

Password Safe 3 file. Got the hash using John's pwsafe2john:

```
mypasswords:$pwsafe$*3*1f295812c442fa6614c8f5442b701be81a817fef1a05e095a420666eabc37e9b*2048*a482b17009d206b7fa3495b40e4113a296efc23bd92b68905929277bdae4a246
```

Need to crack it. 

NullMode's got this!

Cracked with maskprocessor piped into john

based on the hint [a-zA-Z0-9]{0,4} we can come up with a very simple mask attack using mask processor piped into john

```
mp64.bin -1 "?d?l?u" -i "?1?1?1?1" | ./john --stdin pwsafe.txt
```

mask processor, defined a custom mask which included lowercase [a-z], uppercase [A-Z], and digits [0-9], incremental for {0,4} with -i and the mask defined to a length of 4 ?1's.

```
mp64.bin -1 "?d?l?u" -i "?1?1?1?1" | ./john --stdin pwsafe.txt

Installed password safe on a windows 7 vm (took a snapshot of course!)

opened the file with the password above and there's an entry with the flag in it :)
