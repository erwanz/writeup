This is an odd one for a 200 point challenge. We have a 32-bit binary but running it causes a SIGILL. I loaded it up in IDA and it complained that there were too many nodes to display and that I could change it in Options. So I changed it to display 10,000 nodes and the flag appeared in the graph overview:

Flag is **EKO{R3v3rs1ng_Psych0}**
