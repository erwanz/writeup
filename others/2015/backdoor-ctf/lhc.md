`LHC` was a short & sweet challenge in Backdoor CTF. It had a nice 'aha-Erlebnis' moment.

During the CTF, the organizers dropped this challenge. The description mentioned that the flag was hidden in a data file. This data file was kindly provided by the Large Hadron Collider and was 2049 GB large.

I'll let that sink in.

Two-thousand and forty nine **gigabytes**. Downloading it would take more than twenty days. The flag was in the middle of the file, but that still meant downloading more than a terabyte of data.

I fired up `curl` and looked at the download:

```
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/bckdr/medusa$ curl -vvv https://lhc-cdn.herokuapp.com/data.txt > /dev/null
* About to connect() to lhc-cdn.herokuapp.com port 443 (#0)
*   Trying 107.21.223.88...
...snip...

```

Yup, 2200000000000 bytes of data. But wait! `curl` has the option to resume a broken download; that meant that I could control where the download would start. I issued this command and started searching the output for the flag:

```bash
$ curl -vvv https://lhc-cdn.herokuapp.com/data.txt -C 1100000000000 > lhc-middle
...snip...
$ strings -n 20 ./lhc-middle
```

This gave me part of the flag; the description said it was in the middle of the datafile, so I subtracted another 1000 bytes:

```
$ curl -vvv https://lhc-cdn.herokuapp.com/data.txt -C 1099999998999 > lhc-middle
$ strings lhc-middle -n 20
              The flag is: [REDACTED]
```

Simple, really, once you know the trick.
