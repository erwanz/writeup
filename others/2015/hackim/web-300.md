Upon visiting the page, you are challenged with the following cryptic mesage:

`"Find the keys to your home"`

And a link to "loop.php"

Which contains a form to submit something, and a picture of a house.

Also, the hint says `<!-- A place to loo[k]::back. -->`

So home to nerds means "loopback" as can be seen in the popular t-shirts that are made, which would go along with the hint loo[k]::back, especially if you are talking about ipv6!  The shorthand of loopback in IPv6 is ::1, or 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 if you aren't abbreviating.  This is what ended up being the flag!

Not really a "web" challenge per se, but that is how it was solved.
