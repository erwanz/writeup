### Solved by NullMode and barrebas

The crypto 1 challenge for NullconIM presented users with a barmy set of characters:

```

```

Looking closely we identified that a couple of the symbols together made a a short name for an element on the periodic table:

```
Au == Gold
```

The idea became clear to us quite quickly that maybe each element's atomic mass on the periodic table relates to the decimal representation of an ASCII character. Our resident chemist barrebas confirmed the theory and used a handy script to decode the message:

The message decoded to:
```IT IS THE FUNCTION OF SCIENCE TO DISCOVER THE EXISTENCE OF A GENERAL REIGN OF ORDER IN NATURE AND TO FIND THE CAUSES GOVERNING THIS ORDER. AND THIS REFERS IN EQUAL MEASURE TO THE RELATIONS OF MAN - SOCIAL AND POLITICAL - AND TO THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE.```

The decoded passages is from [Dmitri Mendeleev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev) and created the basis of the periodic table we use today.

After a guess or two the answer to the challenge was:

**periodic table**.
